Requirements:

Node (We used nvm to install. any version greater than 8.4.1 has been proven to work. earlier versions may work too.)

Mysql

React

Running node:

**It is important the following commands are run sequentially. start the server first, and then start the react frontend.**

Once the project is cloned to your local repository, run the following commands to start the node server

$ git clone https://github.com/wldarden/Gradesafe.git

$ cd Gradesafe

$ npm install

$ node server\app

Running react project:

Open a new terminal and run the following commands:

$ npm install

$ npm start

$ y

The app is now running. in a chrome browser, go to "localhost:3001"
